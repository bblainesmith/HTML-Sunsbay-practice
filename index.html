    	<h2>Welcome to Sunset Bay Resort!</h2>
    		<br>
    			<p>Welcome to Sunset Bay Resort! We are located in Richville, MN, on beautiful unspoiled Dead Lake, in the heart of Otter Tail County lake country. Our secluded 15 wooded acres and 550 feet of clean sugar sand beach make Sunset Bay a perfect getaway! We offer 8 cabins that have fully equipped kitchens and private bathrooms, 4 campsites with electric and water hookups, a spectacular swimming beach, our own boat launch, game room, fish cleaning house, small store, and shower house. Now under new ownership, the resort has undergone several updates. The old ownerâ€™s home is now Cabin 8, and boasts 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, with a fabulous view of the lake! Also, a relocated game room and remodeled office/store welcome guests. Wifi capability has been extended to include the entire resort, new carpet has been laid in the cabins, and new mattresses have been purchased for every bed. New owners, Jim and Kristin Wherley, are excited to be back home in Minnesota and invite you to come see what Sunset Bay has to offer for your next vacation!</p>

    	<h3>About Dead Lake and Fishing</h3>
    		<br>
    			<p>Dead Lake spans over 7,900 acres with depths over 60 feet. More than 80 percent of the lake has a depth of 15 feet or less. It offers over 36 miles of lakeshore and varied structure. Dead Lake enjoys a reputation for excellent fishing for walleye, large-mouth bass, northern pike, crappie, bluegill and sunfish. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources within its Lake Report states that "Dead Lake has a reputation as one of the best all-around fishing lakes in Otter Tail County." It is known as one of the best lakes for fall fishing in the area, and offers duck hunting opportunities as well.
