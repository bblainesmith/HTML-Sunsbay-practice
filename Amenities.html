			<h3>Boating</h3>
			<p>
				Dead Lake offers an abundance of activities on the water to enjoy, such as catching your next trophy fish, recreational boating, or just floating in the bright sunshine.

				The Sunset Bay office sells boat gas and oil. Paddleboats, a canoe, life jackets and a fish cleaning facility are all available at no charge to guests. Dock space, boats, motors and a pontoon may be rented as demand permits—equipment should be reserved in advance to ensure availability*. Rates for non-guests available upon request.

			<h3>Swimming</h3>
			<p>
				Our beach is one of our best features! We have over 550 feet of clean sugar sand shoreline with a beachside playground and a buoyed swimming area with a raft. Come build that perfect sandcastle or try a paddleboat, canoe, Fun Bug or just float on an inner tube! Please note that there is no lifeguard on duty. Sunscreen is available for purchase in the Office, as well as scrumptious ice cream bars for that lazy afternoon at the beach.

			<p>
				The surrounding area offers numerous golf courses, horseback trail rides, bike trails, a movie theater, a community recreation center, museums, the weekly Perham International Turtle Races, the Turtle Fest in June, the East Otter Tail County Fair in July, plus many antique and specialty shops. There are churches of most denominations, and many places for dining and dancing. Maplewood State Park, Glendalough State Park and Inspiration Peak are not far from Sunset Bay. Also nearby is Minnesota’s first official birding trail, the Pine to Prairie Trail.
